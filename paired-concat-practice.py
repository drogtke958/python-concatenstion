# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
first_name = 'Keily'
middle_name = 'Ann'
last_name = 'Drogt'
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names
print('Keily' + ' Ann' + ' Drogt')


# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name
first_name = 'Anthony'
message = 'Welcome to the game '

full_sentence = message + first_name

print(full_sentence)

# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born
full_name = 'Keily Drogt'
birth_year = '2007'

message = full_name + ' was born in ' + str(birth_year)

print(message)
# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object
country = 'Italy'

visitation = f'If money wasn\'t an issue I would like to visit {country}'

print(visitation)
